                All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato 
                himself which the bodyguard had closed out of respect.The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato been alive, he probably would have deemed 
                this a good moment to lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was not a man which improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate condition, 
                however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert."Mr Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it looked as if the muscles on either side of his 
                mouth were clambering over each other to get out of the way."Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?"Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing.
